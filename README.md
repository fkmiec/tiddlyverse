# tiddlyverse
A multi-wiki tiddlyweb server for TiddlyWiki written in Go.

NOTE - This was forked from https://git.sr.ht/~hokiegeek/tiddlybucket. The foundational work to function as a TiddlyWeb server is mostly from there. This fork adds multi-wiki support, including creating, listing, deleting wikis and the necessary support for custom paths required to make serving multiple wikis from a single server possible without the aid of a proxy server.
